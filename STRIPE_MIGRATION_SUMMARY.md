2. Clicks "Confirm & Book Now"
3. **Redirected to Square's hosted checkout page**
4. Enters payment on Square's site
5. **Redirected back to your site**
6. Shows success page

### After (Stripe)

1. Customer fills form → Reviews booking
2. Clicks "Confirm & Book Now"

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Remove old Square variables (optional)

```

### 2. Set Up Stripe Webhook (Optional)

- Webhook URL: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/stripe/webhook`
- Events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`
- Copy signing secret → Add as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 3. Redeploy

- Push to GitHub (auto-deploys to Vercel)
- Or redeploy from Vercel Dashboard

### 4. Test on Production

- Use Stripe test mode first
- Test all payment scenarios
- Verify emails and database entries

### 5. Go Live

- Switch to Stripe live mode
- Update environment variables with live keys
- Redeploy
- Test with small real payment

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If you need to rollback to Square:

1. **Don't panic** - Your data is safe in Supabase
2. **Revert from Git**:
   ```bash
   git log  # Find commit before Stripe migration
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push
   ```
3. **Restore Square env vars** in Vercel
4. **Redeploy**

But honestly, Stripe is better 😉

---

**Migration completed successfully! 🎉**

All changes are backward compatible with your existing bookings and data. The only thing that changed is the payment provider - everything else works exactly the same way.
