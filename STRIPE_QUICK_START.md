# 🎉 Stripe Integration Complete!

Square payment system has been completely removed and replaced with Stripe. The payment form now appears directly on your website without redirecting users.

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1️⃣ Get Your Stripe Keys

Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) (Test Mode)

- Copy **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_`)
- Copy **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_`)

### 2️⃣ Add to Vercel

Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com) → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

Add these **2 required variables**:

```bash
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = pk_test_your_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = sk_test_your_key_here
```

💡 Make sure to select **all environments** (Production, Preview, Development)

### 3️⃣ Redeploy

Your site auto-deploys when you push to GitHub, but you need to redeploy to load the new variables:

- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
- Click **•••** on latest deployment → **Redeploy**

**That's it!** Your site now accepts payments via Stripe 🎊

## 🧪 Test It

1. Go to your live site
2. Fill out a booking form
3. On payment page, use this test card:
   ```
   Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   Expiry: 12/34
   CVC: 123
   ZIP: 12345
   ```
4. Click "Pay" - payment stays on your site!
5. Check your Stripe Dashboard for the test payment
6. Check Admin Dashboard for the booking
