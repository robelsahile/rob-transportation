# Deployment Steps for Email Confirmation System

## üöÄ What Was Changed

### ‚úÖ Complete Implementation Summary

I've successfully implemented a complete email confirmation system that sends detailed booking confirmations to customers after payment. Here's what was done:

### 1. **Added New Booking Fields**

- ‚úÖ Number of Passengers (optional)
- ‚úÖ Additional Notes/Instructions (optional)

### 2. **Updated All Components**

- ‚úÖ Booking form now captures passengers and notes
- ‚úÖ Review page displays these fields
- ‚úÖ Payment success page includes them
- ‚úÖ Admin dashboard shows all details
- ‚úÖ Email template includes all information

### 3. **Email System Verification**

- ‚úÖ Emails trigger **only after payment confirmation**
- ‚úÖ Uses Resend API for delivery
- ‚úÖ Includes all required booking details
- ‚úÖ Beautiful HTML email template

### 4. **Database Updates**

- ‚úÖ Schema updated with new columns
- ‚úÖ API endpoints handle new fields

## üìã What You Need to Do Before Testing

### Step 1: Update Supabase Database Schema

Run the updated schema in your Supabase SQL editor:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left menu
3. Run this command:

```sql
-- Add passengers and notes columns to bookings table
alter table public.bookings add column if not exists passengers integer;
alter table public.bookings add column if not exists notes text;
```

Or run the complete schema file from: `sql/supabase_schema.sql`

### Step 2: Verify Resend API Key

1. Go to your Vercel project: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your `rob-transportation` project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Verify that `RESEND_API_KEY` is set
5. Make sure it's your **LIVE** API key (starts with `re_`)

If not set, add it:

```
Variable Name: RESEND_API_KEY
Value: re_your_live_api_key_here
Environment: Production, Preview, Development
```

6. **Important:** After adding/updating env variables, you must **redeploy** your app

### Step 3: Deploy Changes to Production

Since your site is connected to GitHub and auto-deploys, you need to:

1. Commit and push all changes:

```bash
cd "/Users/robelsahile/Desktop/Web Development/rob-transportation/rob-transportation"
git add .
git commit -m "Add email confirmation with passengers and notes fields"
git push origin main
```

2. Vercel will automatically deploy
3. Wait for deployment to complete (check Vercel dashboard)

## üß™ How to Test

### Step 1: Make a Test Booking

1. Go to your live site
2. Fill out the booking form:
   - Enter pickup and drop-off locations
   - Select date and time
   - Choose a vehicle
   - Enter your details
   - **NEW:** Add number of passengers (e.g., 2)
   - **NEW:** Add notes (e.g., "2 large suitcases, need help with luggage")

### Step 2: Complete Payment

1. Review your booking (verify passengers and notes show up)
2. Click "Proceed to Payment"
3. Enter test card details:
   - **Card Number:** 4242 4242 4242 4242
   - **Expiry:** Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
   - **CVC:** Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
   - **ZIP:** Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)

### Step 3: Verify Email

1. After successful payment, check the success page
2. You should see: **"‚úÖ Receipt sent to your email and phone!"**
3. Check your email inbox
4. Verify the email includes:
   - ‚úÖ Booking ID
   - ‚úÖ Customer name and email
   - ‚úÖ Pickup and drop-off locations
   - ‚úÖ Date and time
   - ‚úÖ Vehicle type
   - ‚úÖ **Number of passengers** (if you entered it)
   - ‚úÖ **Additional notes** (if you entered them)
   - ‚úÖ Total paid amount
   - ‚úÖ Payment ID

### Step 4: Check Admin Dashboard

1. Log into admin dashboard
2. Find your booking
3. Verify passengers and notes are displayed

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received?

1. **Check spam folder** - Emails might be filtered
2. **Check Vercel logs:**

   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Click on your deployment
   - View "Functions" logs
   - Look for `/api/send-receipt-email` logs

3. **Check Resend dashboard:**

   - Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
   - Sign in with your account
   - Go to "Emails" section
   - Check if email was sent
   - Look for any errors

4. **Verify environment variable:**
   - Make sure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Vercel
   - Make sure you redeployed after adding it

### Database Error?

If you get an error about "passengers" or "notes" column:

- You need to run the SQL schema update in Supabase first
- See Step 1 above

### Payment Fails?

- Make sure you're using the test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Check that `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set in Vercel
- Check Stripe dashboard for errors

## üì± Important Notes

### Email Timing

- Email is sent **immediately after payment confirmation**
- It's automatic - no manual trigger needed
- Customer sees status on success page

### Production vs Test

- Test mode uses Stripe test cards
- Production mode uses real cards
- Resend API key works for both (same key)

### Email Deliverability

If emails go to spam:

1. **Best solution:** Verify your domain in Resend
2. Go to Resend dashboard ‚Üí Domains
3. Add `robtransportation.com`
4. Add DNS records they provide
5. Wait for verification

Once verified, emails will have much better deliverability!

## ‚úÖ Final Checklist

- [ ] Changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Vercel deployment completed successfully
- [ ] Test booking made with passengers and notes
- [ ] Test payment completed successfully
