# Email Confirmation Setup - Complete Guide

## Overview

This document explains the complete email confirmation system for Rob Transportation. The system automatically sends email confirmations to customers after successful payment using the Resend API.

## ‚úÖ Email Trigger Flow

### 1. Payment Confirmation Process

```
Customer Books ‚Üí Reviews ‚Üí Pays (Stripe) ‚Üí Payment Success ‚Üí Email Sent Automatically
```

### 2. Technical Flow

1. **Customer completes payment** in `StripePaymentForm.tsx`

   - Stripe confirms payment with status "succeeded"
   - `paymentIntent.id` is captured

2. **Payment success page loads** (`PaymentSuccess.tsx`)

   - Component automatically loads booking details from localStorage
   - Immediately sends booking to admin API (`/api/bookings`)
   - **Automatically triggers email sending** via `/api/send-receipt`

3. **Email is sent** only after payment confirmation
   - Email endpoint: `/api/send-receipt-email.ts`
   - Uses Resend API with `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - Email includes all booking details
